Project Overview
This project is a sleek product listing page that fetches smartphone data from an API and displays it with a clean, responsive design. It includes a hero section, a search bar, sorting functionality, and a dark mode toggle.

How It Works
Fetching Data: Used fetch() to get product details from an API.
Displaying Products: Dynamically created product cards with images, titles, and buttons.
Search & Sort: Implemented search filtering and sorting with JavaScript.
Dark Mode: Added a toggle button to switch themes.
The goal was to keep the UI smooth, modern, and user-friendly.
